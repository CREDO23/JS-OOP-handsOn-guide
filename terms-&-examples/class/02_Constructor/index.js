// ======= CONSTRUCTOR =======

/**
 * 
 * As stated, constructors are functions that are called when creating new objects from a class.
 * The constructor is responsible for initializing and settinp up everything for new instances.
 * 
 * Since it is a function, it can receive arguments. For constructors, it is not convenient to add
 * an explicit return statement because there's an implicit one.
 * 
 * We have seen that, when new instances are created, a plain javascript object is created where the
 * constructor will do the initialization, if there are properties defined out of the constructor
 * (in the class's body) the constructor will start setting all of them to that plain javascript object.
 * If there are other settings defined in the constructor, they will be executed. 
 * When finished, the constructor will return that plain javascript object which will be our new instance.
 * 
 * ==> [this] keyword is used to refer to the instance that is being created.
 * 
 * We have also seen that, when the constructor finishes its job, all methods defined in the class will be added to
 * its prototype (a javascript object that can contain methods or other properties) then set it to be the 
 * prototype of the new instance created so that the instance can use all of those methods.
 * 
 * ğŸš« ğŸš« ğŸš« ğŸš« ğŸš« ğŸš« ğŸš«
 * 
 * Adding a return statement that returns an object type (Array,Object, Map, etc) will override the object set up
 * by the constructor.
 *

- We created a class 'User' with a constructor that helps us to create new users with a first name and a last name.

- The (const user1 = new User('John', 'Doe')) creates a new user 'user1' with a first (John) name and last (Doe).

- (user1) ----->`, user1, `

- (user1.sayHi()) -----> ${ps(user1.sayHi())} ${s4}`)

- We created a class 'Admin' with a constructor that helps us to create new users with a first name and a last name.

- We also added an EXPLICIT return STATEMENT inside the constructor ( return new Date()).

- The (const admin1 = new Admin('Richard', 'LeGrand')) should create a new admin 'admin1' with a first name (Richard)
  and a last name (LeGrand).

-  (admin1) -----> ${ns(admin1)} ${s4}`)
