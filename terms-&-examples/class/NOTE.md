# Class

We have already seen what is an object and how to implement it in JavaScript. Normally, we should start talking about classes but we started with objects because they are the main concept to understand in object oriented programming.

In object oriented programming, "class" represents a template that define the structure of a given type of objects. That means, we can use that template to create objects and those objects will be instances of that class.

The class defines :

- The responsibility objects instantiated by it will have in the program. Which involve:
    - Defining or providing initial values of states
    - Implementing behaviors.
