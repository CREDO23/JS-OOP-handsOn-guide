# Oriented Object Programming paradigm

Object-oriented object programming is a programming paradigm that is based on objects. In general, such objects are models of real-world entities in the program (e.g., a person, a vehicle, a home, etc.); each entity has its own characteristics (properties/attributes) and actions (methods/procedures) that are organized in a single location called object.
