# Inheritence

As a fundamental concept in software development, inheritance enables the creation of new classes that inherit attributes and behaviours from existing classes, improving code reusability and overall efficiency.

So here we have a parent class (a base class), and we can extend it and create new classes (child/derived classes) that inherit attributes and behaviours of the parent class (base class). Think of dericed or child class as a specific version of the parent class:

E.g:

Let's consider an example to illustrate how inheritance works in OOP. Suppose we have a parent class "Animal" with properties like "name" and "age" and methods > > such as "eat" and "sleep". We can create a derived class "Dog" that inherits these properties and methods from the "Animal" class. Additionally, the "Dog" class > can add new methods like "bark" and "fetch" to enhance its functionality.
